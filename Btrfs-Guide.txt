# Because the Subvol's dont have fix size :)

# Subvol's share the free space that is free space show by / or /home will be same
# However it doesnot mean you cant have limit imposed on the subvol's, 
# For that we have QUOTA'S

# Snapshot's => It will give us the power to revert back into time where the snapshot was created !
## Create a snapshot
sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /home /home/home-snapshot-1 	## We need to tell where to mount the snapshot

## List the snapshots/subvol, Snapshots are also subvol's
sudo btrfs subvolume list /home 

## Revert to the snapshot, edit the /etc/fstab and change the 'subvolid' of of /home to snapshot 
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak ## Create backup
sudo nano /etc/fstab 			  ## Remove subvol and use subvolid
reboot

# Create subvol 
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/btrfs-data/myvol-1
btrfs subvolume list /mnt/btrfs-data

# Check usage
btrfs filesystem df /mnt/btrfs-data
